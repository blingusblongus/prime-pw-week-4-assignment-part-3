    <ul>
      <li>I've noticed that often people will use const with arrays, which normally makes sense,
      because you can still change the stuff inside. However, when it came to making the
      empty cart function, I realized that using const disallows emptying the basket by simply
      reassigning it with 'basket = []'.
      Is there a better way to
      empty the array, or do I just have to use the 'let' declaration if I know I might need to
      empty the array?</li>
    </ul>
